instances including:
1) Fattahi instances;
2) NI instances.

1. For instances  Fattahi-1C and NI-1C: (the number of job family: 1)

row1£ºthe number of jobs/ the number of machines/ the maximum value of the number of operations of all jobs

The first column of the first row before each matrix: the number of operations of each job

The number of columns of the matrix: the number of machines
The number of rows of the matrix: the number of operations per job. 
Each value in the matrix: the processing time for each operation on each machine.

2. For instances  Fattahi-2C  to Fattahi-4C and NI-2C to NI-4C: (the number of job family: 2 to 4)
row1£ºthe number of jobs/ the number of machines/ the maximum value of the number of operations of all jobs

The first column of the first row before each matrix: the number of operations of each job
The second column of the first row before each matrix: the job family index of each job (each job is belonging to and only belonging to one job family)

The number of columns of the matrix: the number of machines
The number of rows of the matrix: the number of operations per job. 
Each value in the matrix: the processing time for each operation on each machine.
